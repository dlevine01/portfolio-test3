### measure inequity in tree canopy change
Extreme heat is one of the most dangerous weather events and an increasing threat under climate change. Tree cover provides shade and absorbs heat, blunting some of the effects of the 'urban heat island.' New York City's MillionTrees campaign added trees citywide. 

Using extremely high resolution LiDAR data capturing change in tree canopy cover, this project assessed whether the changes in tree cover were equitable.

By mapping and modeling local tree gain (or loss) against neighborhood demographics, the study found  trends and local outliers.

In general, areas with the greatest heat vulnerability also saw the most gain in tree cover (good news!). Areas with more new residents also saw disproportionate gain in tree cover, which could indicate that more tree cover is added in gentrifying areas, or that as areas are converted from industrial to residential zones, tree canopy is increased.
