Hurricane Ida revealed the dangerous consequences of concentrated rainfall and urban flooding, a problem that will only grow as New York City's climate changes. Green infrastructure can be the fastest and most cost effective way to reduce storm risk. By reviewing analysis tools and bureaucratic systems, I [designed a program](static/files/How-NYC-Parks-can-use-urban-forest-analysis-to-reduce-flood-risk.pdf) NYC Parks could use to measure how their tree planting and green infrastructure designs reduce stormwater risk and focus on areas where these projects could most reduce flood vulnerability.
