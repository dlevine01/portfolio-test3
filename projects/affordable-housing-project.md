As New York City faces a growing affordable housing crisis, current programs and policies are not keeping up with the need. This project evaluated the de Blasio administration's multi-pronged Housing New York plan. Modeling the locations and scale of projects based on unique parcel features and neighborhood demographics allowed for forecasts of future construction and the likely number of units of a new building at any site. This prediction was mapped against the local demand for housing, measured through 311 inquiries.
